Before start coding and compiling, you must follow two steps:

1. Use ```sudo apt-get update```: this command line on Terminal will provide all the packages
necessary to upgrade Codespace IDE;
2. Use ```sudo apt-get install lua5.3```: after putting this at the command line, you can already
install the Lua Compiler. Once installed, compiling will execute normally.
